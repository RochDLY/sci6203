Nous revenons notamment sur les problématiques de recherche à l'origine de la démarche, les étapes et réflexions théoriques et techniques qui ont rythmé l'évolution de la recherche ainsi que ses récents développements. À partir de l'analyse de cette expérience, nous essayons de comprendre comment émergent les conditions théoriques, épistémologiques et méthodologiques qui structurent un projet de recherche. La thèse que nous souhaitons défendre ici est que loin d’être le fruit d’un·e seul·e chercheur·e, la pensée est le fruit d’un ensemble complexe de conjonctures médiatrices qui comprennent un ensemble de forces hétérogènes dont émergent ensuite des personnes, des techniques, des textes, des plateformes, des méthodes, des collectifs.},

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

	abstract = {This paper announces version 1.0 of the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK), an NLP framework for pre-modern languages. The vast majority of NLP, its algorithms and software, is created with assumptions particular to living languages, thus neglecting certain important characteristics of largely non-spoken historical languages. Further, scholars of pre-modern languages often have different goals than those of living-language researchers. To fill this void, the CLTK adapts ideas from several leading NLP frameworks to create a novel software architecture that satisfies the unique needs of pre-modern languages and their researchers. Its centerpiece is a modular processing pipeline that balances the competing demands of algorithmic diversity with pre-configured defaults. The CLTK currently provides pipelines, including models, for almost 20 languages.},

	abstract = {Standard deep learning systems require thousands or millions of examples to learn a concept, and cannot integrate new concepts easily. By contrast, humans have an incredible ability to do one-shot or few-shot learning. For instance, from just hearing a word used in a sentence, humans can infer a great deal about it, by leveraging what the syntax and semantics of the surrounding words tells us. Here, we draw inspiration from this to highlight a simple technique by which deep recurrent networks can similarly exploit their prior knowledge to learn a useful representation for a new word from little data. This could make natural language processing systems much more flexible, by allowing them to learn continually from the new words they encounter.},

	abstract = {We describe here our work in creating treebanks – large collections of syntactically annotated data – for Latin and Ancient Greek. While the treebanks themselves present important datasets for traditional research in philology and linguistics, the layers of structured knowledge they contain (including disambiguated lemma, morphological, and syntactic information for every word) help oﬀset the comparatively small size of extant Greek and Latin texts for text mining applications. We describe two such uses for these Classical treebanks – discovering lexical knowledge from a large corpus with the help of a small treebank, and identifying patterns of text reuse.},

	doi = {10.1109/eScience.2014.14},
	abstract = {Papyrologists analyze, transcribe, and edit papyrus fragments in order to enrich modern lives by better understanding the linguistics, culture, and literature of the ancient world. One of their common tasks is to match an unknown fragment to a known manuscript. This is especially challenging when the fragments are damaged and contain only limited information (e.g., due to deterioration). In the last 100 years, only about 10\% of the more than 500,000 fragments recovered from the Egyptian village of Oxyrhynchus have been edited. We do not know what new ancient texts might be found and what can be learned from them, but using current methods of identification this process will take in excess of 1000 years. The identification of an anonymous string of characters with a collection of known text sequences is ubiquitous in computational biology. Genes are often represented by a sequence of continuous characters, each of which denotes an amino acid. Relationships are inferred by finding multi-letter patterns shared between the anonymous sequence and a known sequence. This process is commonly referred to as genetic sequence alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that uses modern genetic sequence alignment algorithms as a method for identifying Ancient Greek text fragments. This application will offer papyrologists and other professionals in the humanities the ability to rapidly identify severely damaged texts. This approach leverages a new form of non-contextual, multi-line text identification for the Greek language that can greatly accelerate the tedious task of transcription and identification.},
